# MVC Framework
It is basic MVC structural framework and its documentation is similar to laravel when you will use it then you will know very easily how it works if you have worked in any framework. I'm really sorry, i don't have documentation yet because i just made it while practicing php and its class and learned whole working of framework from laracast.com.
